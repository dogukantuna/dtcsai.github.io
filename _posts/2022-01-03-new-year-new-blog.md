I would like to start this year with this eruditely quote, what a lovely quote. The quote that never loses its validity in every minute of your life. For me, following this quote is kind of pursuing my passion. If you are learning, discovering about something that means you are passionate. If you are passionate, you are learning & discovering in the same way. Isn't pursuing passion one of the most praiseworthy & modest act? Isn't it true that you should "seize the day & pursue your passion!"? I think it is. Because of this, posting this personal update.

Here are the resolutions for v22!

From now on, I'm planning to use my blog for my AI research in the great majority. My AI study interest lies at the interface between fine-grained AI computing, neural network architectures, computational imaging where I develop new approaches for testing theoretical issues & paradigms. Except this, I'm also planning to share YouTube videos, introductory blog posts here. I hope I can make AI more accessible to people.

*"Why?"*

In a nutshell, AI technologies genuinely fascinates me on many levels just like everyone else. The major breakthroughs happened in recent years & even in recent months, confirms this. The concept, practices & ecosystem of AI brings a new era of computing advancements. This is incredibly exciting because we're just getting started on the process of making this long-awaited dream a reality, a primacy. There are so many things out there waiting to be discovered in AI research. In general perspective, I hope future-proof AI approaches help us create a better sustainable world & suppress our hunger for knowledge, discover.
